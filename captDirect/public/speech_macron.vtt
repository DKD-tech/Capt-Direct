1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. President of the European Bank, dear Mario Draghi.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Mr. President of the Republic, dear Sergio.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Madam the Chancellor, dear Angela.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Mr. President of the L'Hondes.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Madam President, the elected President of the European Commission, dear Ursula.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Madam President, the designated President of the European Bank, dear Christine.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, and the governors.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Mesdames and messieurs, chers amis.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we are so many today in Francfort, around you, cher Mario.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It is not only to celebrate a mandate well-managed by the President of the European Central Bank.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What is gathering us today is far above the cadre of monetary policy.

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I will leave, by the way, to others, more qualified than me.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And to look and to extend the immense heritage that you have left in the matter.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What we celebrate above all today is the action of a man who has brought up very high the European dream.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And who has brought it in this institution.

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Who has shown, during the financial crisis, all his solidity, his robustiveness.

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A man who has been, in his discourse and his decisions, a dignified heritage of the founding of Europe.

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This affiliation, dear Mario, places you in the steps of Jean Monet, Robert Schumann, Conrad Adenauer.

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And of your illustrious compatriots, Alcide GaspÃ©ry and Altiero Spinelli.

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In Milan, a few weeks ago, you pronounced one of these discourses that have marked your mandate.

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And that are now engraved in the stone that builds Europe.

22
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
To the students of the Catholic University who were giving you a prize.

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You evoked three qualities that make a good public decision maker.

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Knowledge, courage, and humility.

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
These qualities, dear Mario, you have honored and incarnated them here.

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You have gained knowledge through academic formation and exceptional professional experience.

27
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You have constantly sought it with the most brilliant researchers in economics.

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And you have transmitted it through your research and your conferences.

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This expertise, recognized by all, has been crucial to establish your intellectual authority.

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
With your peers, market observers, and well beyond.
